README file for cmb personal utility library
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a small library of useful functions I find myself re-using,
gathered together in one place for ease.

    Colours.c    A series of routines to set colours, for use in
                 text output to stdout - ie, not inside curses.

    Curses.c     Various utility routines common when I am building
                 a curses application.

    FileUtils.c  File handling utility routines.

    Misc.c       Miscellaneous utility routines.

    cmb.c        Place to put global variables and other core, non header
                 stuff for the library routines.

    cmb.h        Header file for the library
